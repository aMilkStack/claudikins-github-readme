# Pen-Wielding Protocol

**Goal:** Write a production-ready GitHub README that feels authentically human.

## Step 1: Ingest Context
Read the outputs from the preparatory skills to establish the content:
1.  **Facts:** `deep-dive` report (Stack, friction points, install complexity).
2.  **Future:** `crystal-ball` analysis (Roadmap table, technical debt).
3.  **Voice:** `brain-jam` decision (The chosen angle: Deep Tech vs Pragmatic).
4.  **Plan:** `think-tank` findings (Selected badges, sections, and visual strategy).

## Step 2: Load Standards (Reference Files)
Read the governance files to establish the form:
1.  `references/style-guide.md` (The "Anti-Slop" rules and Banned Words).
2.  `references/structures.md` (The section templates).
3.  `references/visuals.md` (The density and diagram rules).
4.  `references/antipatterns.md` (The final checklist).

## Step 3: Execution (Writing the README)
Write the complete README.md. Follow these constraints strictly:

### A. The "Anti-Slop" Filter (Governance: style-guide.md)
*   **Check every sentence** against the Banned Words list (No "Delve", "Seamless", "Unleash").
*   **Enforce Patterns:**
    *   Use **"The Hook"** (Pattern A) in the *Description*.
    *   Use **"The Hammer"** (Pattern B) in the *Features* list.
    *   Use **"The Trust Builder"** (Pattern C) in *Usage/Configuration*.

### B. Visual Engineering (Governance: visuals.md)
*   Insert specific placeholders for the visuals identified in `think-tank`.
*   Format: `> **Visual:** [Description from think-tank] (Use tool: VHS/Mermaid)`
*   **Visual Density:** Ensure no block of text exceeds 300 words without a visual break.

### C. Structural Integrity (Governance: structures.md)
*   **Quick Start:** Must adhere to the "Time-to-Joy" rule (< 3 commands). Use the template.
*   **Roadmap:** Insert the table generated by `crystal-ball` near the end.
*   **Badges:** Use the exact list derived from `think-tank`.

## Step 4: The Final Audit
Before outputting, review the text against `references/antipatterns.md`.
*   [ ] Are paragraphs < 4 sentences?
*   [ ] Are M-dashes (—) removed?
*   [ ] Is the "Delve" index 0?
*   [ ] Are headers semantic (e.g., "Zero-Config Build" vs "Features")?
*   [ ] Does the Quick Start work in < 30 seconds?

## Output
Present the final README in a single, copy-pasteable Markdown block.
